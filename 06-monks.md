## Introduction

Monasticism is still misunderstood by many Christians today. Some see it as an escape from the world, while others view it as a legalistic approach to spirituality. However, monasticism has played a significant role in the history of Christianity, particularly in the areas of mission and cultural engagement.

The Desert Fathers and Mothers, who lived in the deserts of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine during the 3rd and 4th centuries, were some of the earliest monastic figures. They sought to live a life of radical discipleship, renouncing worldly possessions and dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and contemplation.

:class: tip
Monks would see their life style as separating oneself from worldly distractions in order to commit to the spiritual struggle towards maturity in Christ. This maturity would then be a testimony to the world and a means for mission.

Asceticism  can be conceived as the voluntary exercise, practice and/or training in order to separate oneself from worldly distractions and focus on union with God.

(monk)=
The word "monk" comes from the Greek word "monachos," which means "solitary" or "alone." Monks typically live in communities, but they also spend significant time in solitude and contemplation.

(asceticism)=
The word asceticism comes from the Greek word "askesis," which means "exercise" or "training." Ascetic practices can include fasting, celibacy, poverty, and other forms of self-denial.

## Why is Monasticism Attractive?

Monasticism offers an alternative to those who are surrounded by the chaos of the bloodshed and moral decay of the Roman Empire. The constant instability and uncertainty of the times made the monastic life appealing to many Christians who sought a way to live out their faith in a more radical and committed manner.

But monasticism is not just an escape from the world. In the 4th century, monasticism is going to be a way to reject the syncretism and hierarchical new structure of the Church after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Monks sought to live a life of radical discipleship, renouncing worldly possessions and dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and contemplation.

Monks are mostly evangelizing. They are the missionaries of their era. Therefore, they are seen as spiritual authorities by the people. People would come to them for spiritual guidance and healing. Interestingly, as monks get busier with the demand for their services, they would seek to find places more remote to continue their spiritual practices. There was plenty of desert in the regions of Egypt and Syria.

## Forms of Monasticism

Monasticism took various forms in the early centuries of Christianity. Some monks lived as hermits, withdrawing completely from society to live in solitude. Others lived in communal settings, known as cenobitic monasticism, where they shared resources and responsibilities while still maintaining a commitment to prayer and contemplation. The main forms of monasticism will be explored below.

### Anchrotic Monasticism

Anchrotic monasticism, also known as eremitic monasticism, involves living as a hermit in complete solitude. Anchrotic monks would often live in caves or small huts in remote areas, dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and contemplation. They sought to separate themselves from the distractions of the world in order to focus on their relationship with God.

Some Scripture passages that inspired anchrotic monasticism include:

- Acts 4:34-35: "There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need."
- Matthew 19:21: "Jesus answered, 'If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'"
- Matthew 6:34: "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."

(StAnthony)=
St. Anthony the Great (c. 251-356) is often considered the father of anchrotic monasticism. He lived in the Egyptian desert for many years, dedicating himself to a life of prayer and contemplation. His example inspired many others to follow the anchrotic monastic path.

(anchrotic)=
The word anchrotic comes from the Greek word "anakhorein," which means "to withdraw" or "to retreat."

### Cenobitic Monasticism

Cenobitic monasticism involves living in communal settings, where monks share resources and responsibilities while still maintaining a commitment to prayer and contemplation. Cenobitic monks would often live in monasteries, where they would follow a strict daily routine of prayer, work, and study. Some Scripture passages that inspired cenobitic monasticism include:

(cenobitic)=
The word cenobitic comes from the Greek word "koinos," which means "common" or "shared."

Pachomius (c. 292-348) is often credited with founding the first cenobitic monastery in Egypt around 320 AD. He established a set of rules and guidelines for communal living, which became known as the Rule of St. Pachomius. This rule emphasized the importance of obedience, humility, and communal responsibility.

"If you build it, they will come." Monasteries became centers of learning, agriculture, and hospitality. They provided a place for spiritual growth and development, as well as a refuge from the chaos of the outside world.

### Semi-Eremitic Monasticism

Semi-eremitic monasticism is a hybrid form of monasticism that combines elements of both anchrotic and cenobitic monasticism. Semi-eremitic monks would live in small groups or pairs, often in remote areas, but they would still maintain some level of communal living and shared resources. This form of monasticism allowed for a balance between solitude and community, providing monks with the opportunity for both personal spiritual growth and mutual support.

### Stylites

Stylites were a unique form of monasticism that involved living on top of a pillar or column. Stylites would often spend years living in this elevated position, dedicating themselves to prayer and contemplation. This form of monasticism was seen as a way to separate oneself from the distractions of the world while still remaining visible to the community below.

Simeon the Elder or Simeon Stylites (c. 390-459) is one of the most famous stylites. He lived on top of a pillar for over 30 years, attracting many visitors who sought his spiritual guidance and blessings.

## Jerome

St. Jerome (c. 347-420) was a Christian scholar and translator best known for his Latin translation of the Bible, known as the Vulgate. He spent much of his life in the desert as a hermit, dedicating himself to prayer, study, and the pursuit of holiness. Jerome's writings and teachings had a significant impact on the development of monasticism and Christian theology.

Jerome emphasized the importance of asceticism and spiritual discipline, encouraging Christians to live lives of holiness and devotion. He also advocated for the study of Scripture and the pursuit of knowledge, believing that a deep understanding of God's Word was essential for spiritual growth.
