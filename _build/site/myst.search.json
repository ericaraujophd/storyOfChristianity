The posture we assume when we pray is not a trivial matter. It reflects our understanding of who God is and who we are in relation to Him.\n\nProf. Rylaarsdam explained the origins of the expression “The Lord be with you”, recalling Boaz’s greeting to his workers in Ruth 2:4. This greeting is not just a polite expression; it carries deep theological significance. It acknowledges God’s presence and blessing in our lives, especially in communal worship settings.\n\nHe also presented the three postures for prayer in the ancient church (and guess what? sitting was not one of them!): standing, kneeling, and prostrating. Each posture has its own meaning and significance:\n\nStanding is a posture of respect and attentiveness,\n\nKneeling is a posture of humility and submission, and\n\nProstrating is a posture of total surrender and worship, also connected to repentance.\n\nAfter a few presentations among the students, we turned to the main question of the lecture: Why study the history of Christianity? Or as stated by Prof. Rylaarsdam, “What difference does it make to know church history?”","type":"content","url":"/why-study#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1.1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"1.

Reasons to Study Church History"},"content":"Many reasons were presented during the lecture, and I would like to summarize the main ones here:\n\nTo understand our identity as Christians: Church history helps us to see how our faith has been shaped and formed over the centuries. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story, a story that goes back to the early church and continues to this day.\n\nTo learn from the past: By studying church history, we can learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. We can see how they navigated challenges and controversies, and we can apply those lessons to our own lives and ministries.\n\nTo appreciate the diversity of the Christian tradition: Church history reveals the rich diversity of the Christian tradition. It shows us how different cultures and contexts have shaped the way we understand and practice our faith.\n\nTo deepen our faith: Studying church history can deepen our faith by helping us to see the faithfulness of God throughout the ages. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story of God’s work in the world.\n\nThe main take was that church history forms Christians for a missional encounter with culture as we observe how the church in the past did that. It is not just an academic exercise but a practical one that equips us to live out our faith in the world today.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-1-reasons-to-study-church-history","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1.1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"2.

If we do the exercise of pretending we are some alien anthropologists studying human culture, we can approach church history with a sense of curiosity and openness. We can learn to appreciate the differences and similarities between our own context and that of past Christians.\n\nThe example given in class invited us to travel to different ages and places in church history, trying to understand what Christians were doing, what were their priorities, and how they expressed their faith. This exercise can help us to see church history not just as a series of dates and events but as a living and dynamic story of God’s work in the world.\n\nAfter pretending to be an alien grad student, the question posed was:\n\nWhat should the grad student in interplanetary religions conclude about Christianity?\n\nOne of the points raised was the fact that Christianity has been remarkably adaptive and resilient throughout history. It has been able to take root in diverse cultures and contexts, while still maintaining its core message and identity. This adaptability is a testament to the power of the Christian faith and its ability to speak to the human condition across time and space.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-2-an-alien-tropological-experience","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1.1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"3.

How to Study Church History"},"content":"A few quotes were presented to guide us in our study of church history:\n\nIn modernity, church history has often been taught not “in terms of the missionary advance in successive encounters of the gospel with different forms of human culture and society, but rather as a story of the doctrinal and other conflicts within the life of the church.” (L. Newbigin)\n\nI wish someone had told me in seminary that the Christological and Trinitarian controversies of the second and third century were first and foremost issues of contextualization. (L. Newbigin)\n\nWe have to ask in all sincerity whether the study of the history of the church ought not to be completely redesigned. (David Bosch)\n\nThese quotes highlight the importance of approaching church history with a missional and contextual perspective. We should not just focus on doctrinal disputes but also on how the gospel has been communicated and lived out in different cultural settings.\n\nTo provide a tool for studying church history, Prof. Rylaarsdam introduced us the two principles for missional encounters with culture:\n\nThe indigenizing principle: Christianity enters a culture and finds customs that embody the way of Christ. Christians celebrate the culture. They are residents in it.\n\nThe pilgrim principle: Christianity enters a culture and finds ways in which the culture contradicts the way and teachings of Christ. Christians seek to embody alternatives. They are not fully at home; they are resident aliens (paroikoi) in it.\n\nThese two principles are constantly in conflict and tension with each other throughout church history. Christians have to navigate between celebrating the culture and embodying alternatives to it.\n\nOn paroikoi\n\nThe connection of the pilgrim principle and the idea of Christians as “resident aliens” (paroikoi) reminded me of 1 Peter 2:11-12:\n\nDear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles (paroikoi), to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.\n\nThe biggest challenge presented for us is to pursue “faithful contextualization rather than syncretistic accommodation”.\n\nSince the Gospel is translatable by its very nature, it can take on many cultural forms. In that translation the Gospel both affirms the creational good and judges the idolatrous twisting of all cultural forms. (Mike Goheen)\n\nWe then passed to the next discussion on the way to study church history faithfully by asking in each historical context:\n\nWhat’s my context?\n\nWhat’s the gospel in this context?\n\nWhat’s the mission of God’s people in this context?\n\nAs a ministry leader, how can I equip people for mission in this context?\n\nThis will be the topic for the next lecture.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-3-how-to-study-church-history","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1.1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"Prayers"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/why-study#prayers","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1.1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"Prayers"},"content":"Below are some prayers from early Christian writers that were shared during the lecture.\n\nClement of Alexandria’s PrayerBe kind to us, your little children, Lord – that is what we ask of you as our Tutor.  \nGrant that by doing what you have told us to do, \n    we may achieve a faithful likeness to the Image \n    and find you to be a good God and a lenient Judge.\nMay we all live in the peace that comes from you.\n    May we journey towards your city, \n        sailing through the waters of sin untouched by the waves, \n        carried peacefully along by the Holy Spirit, your Wisdom beyond all telling.  \nNight and day until the last day of all, \n    may our praises give you thanks, our thanksgiving praise you:  \n    you who alone are both Father and Son, \n    the Son who is our Tutor and our Teacher, together with the Holy Spirit.  \nAmen.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#prayers","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/images-1","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1"},"content":"Here are some images that represent the prayer postures discussed in Lecture 2: Roman Persecution.","type":"content","url":"/images-1","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1","lvl2":"Images related to the Roman Empire context"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/images-1#images-related-to-the-roman-empire-context","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1","lvl2":"Images related to the Roman Empire context"},"content":"\n\nThe Roman Empire in 117 AD at its greatest extent, at the time of Trajan’s death (with its vassals in pink) \n\nSource","type":"content","url":"/images-1#images-related-to-the-roman-empire-context","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1: Roman Persecution"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/roman-persecution","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1: Roman Persecution"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/roman-persecution","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1: Roman Persecution","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/roman-persecution#introduction","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.1: Roman Persecution","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"This lecture happened on September 8, 2025, and it focused on the Roman empire’s persecution of Christians.

The council was convened to address the question of whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to follow Jewish customs and laws, such as circumcision and dietary restrictions. The council ultimately decided that Gentile converts did not need to follow these customs, but they were asked to abstain from certain practices that were particularly offensive to Jewish Christians, such as eating food sacrificed to idols.\n\nThe meeting of the council was significant because it marked a turning point in the early church’s understanding of its identity and mission. It affirmed that Christianity was not simply a sect of Judaism but a distinct faith that welcomed Gentile believers. This decision helped to pave the way for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.\n\nIt is quite fascinating that they wrote down the decisions of the council in a letter to be sent to the churches. This shows the importance of communication and unity in the early church, as well as the recognition that the decisions made at the council had implications for the wider Christian community.\n\nThe letter to the gentiles from Acts 15\n\n28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:\n\n29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality.

The empire was vast and diverse, encompassing many different cultures and religions. The Roman government was generally tolerant of different religious practices, as long as they did not threaten the stability of the empire. However, Christians were often viewed with suspicion and hostility by the Roman authorities.\n\nPolitically, there is unity and peace in the Roman Empire. No major wars were happening for the last 200 years. This period is known as the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. The empire was ruled by a series of emperors who maintained order and stability throughout the empire. The mentality that trusting in the goodness of human beings brought the hope of a permanent social order.\n\nThe Roman ideal became part of the cultural fabric of the empire. The emperor was seen as a divine figure, and loyalty to the empire was considered a civic duty.

The early Christian martyrs were often persecuted by the Roman authorities for their refusal to renounce their faith and participate in the state-sanctioned religious practices, which were seen as a threat to the unity and stability of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe stories of the martyrs were highly influential in shaping the identity and theology of the early Christian church. Their courage and steadfastness in the face of persecution served as powerful examples of faith and devotion, inspiring other Christians to remain faithful even in difficult circumstances. The martyrdom of early Christians was often seen as a form of participation in the suffering and death of Christ, and it was believed that those who died for their faith would receive special rewards in the afterlife.","type":"content","url":"/martyrs#who-were-the-martyrs","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl2":"What was the Gospel for the Martyrs?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/martyrs#what-was-the-gospel-for-the-martyrs","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl2":"What was the Gospel for the Martyrs?"},"content":"A great deal of Scriptural texts were used by the early Christians to encourage and strengthen the faith of the martyrs. Some of the key passages that were particularly meaningful to them include:\n\nMark 8:34-35: “Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.’”\n\nMatthew 5:10-12: “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”\n\nPhilippians 1:21: “For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.”\n\n2 Corinthians 12:10: “That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”\n\n2 Timothy 4:6-8: “For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.”\n\nRevelation 14:13: “Then I heard a voice from heaven say, ‘Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’ ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit, ‘they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.’”\n\nRomans 8:35-39: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: ‘For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.’ No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n\nRevelation 2:10: “Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.”\n\nIt is important to remember that Stephen’s martyrdom and Jesus’ crucifixion set models for the early Christian martyrs. Stephen, as the first Christian martyr, exemplified forgiveness and faithfulness even in the face of death (Acts 7:54-60). Jesus’ own suffering and death on the cross served as the ultimate example of sacrificial love and obedience to God’s will (Philippians 2:5-11). These examples provided a theological framework for understanding martyrdom as a participation in Christ’s own suffering and a witness to the truth of the gospel.\n\nThe martyrs of the early church would see themselves as \n\nParoikoi (resident aliens), a very important concept for the martyrs, as they saw themselves as pilgrims in this world, not fully at home, and looking forward to their true home in heaven.\n\nLater, when Christianity become legal in the Roman Empire, the pilgrim principle will be co-existing with the indigenizing principle, which will create tensions in the church.\n\nThe paradox of the Christian life is a very good place to reflect upon the experience of the martyrs. Christians are called to live in the world but not be of the world (John 17:14-16). They are to be in the world as witnesses to the truth of the gospel, but they are also called to embody an alternative way of life that reflects the values of the kingdom of God.\n\nThe concept of dual citizenship captures this paradox, as Christians are citizens of both the earthly kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. This dual citizenship creates a tension between the demands of the world and the demands of faith, which the martyrs experienced in a profound way.\n\nDiognetus Epistle provides a beautiful description of the Christian identity as resident aliens:\n\n“They live in their respective countries, but only as resident aliens \n\nparoikoi; they participate in all things as citizens, and they endure all things as foreigners [...] They marry like everyone else and have children, but they do not expose them once they are born. They share their meals but not their sexual partners [...] To put the matter simply, what the soul is in the body, this is what Christians are in the world.”\n\nEpistle to Diognetus (2c)\n\nOn Diognetus Epistle\n\n“They love all men, and they are persecuted by all.”","type":"content","url":"/martyrs#what-was-the-gospel-for-the-martyrs","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/martyrs#what-persecutions-did-the-martyrs-face","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"content":"First, it is important to understand that the persecutions faced by the early Christian martyrs were not constant or uniform throughout the Roman Empire.

As Christianity emerged from Judaism, there was this misunderstanding that Christians were just a sect of Judaism.\n\nHowever, as Christianity began to emerge as a distinct movement from Judaism, tensions arose between the two groups. Christians were often viewed with suspicion and hostility by Jewish authorities, who saw them as a threat to their religious and social order.","type":"content","url":"/martyrs#jews-against-christians","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl3":"Nero against Christians","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/martyrs#nero-against-christians","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl3":"Nero against Christians","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"content":"There was certainly an increase in persecutions during the reign of Emperor Nero (54-68 AD), particularly after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, which Nero blamed on the Christians. This led to widespread persecution and martyrdom of Christians in Rome. \n\nGonzalez, 2010 will again help us understand that Christians were easy targets for Nero, as they were a marginalized and misunderstood group in Roman society. They were often accused of atheism (due to their refusal to worship the Roman gods) and of engaging in secret and subversive activities. This made them vulnerable to persecution, especially during times of crisis or unrest.\n\nOn Nero’s Persecution\n\nInterestingly, there are no records of empire-wide persecutions of Christians until the reign of Emperor Decius (249-251 AD). Decius issued an edict in 250 AD that required all citizens of the empire to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods and the emperor, which Christians refused to do.

In a letter dated around 112 AD, Pliny sought guidance from Trajan on how to deal with Christians who were being brought before him for trial. Trajan’s response, known as the “Rescript of Trajan,” provided important instructions on the treatment of Christians.\n\nIn his rescript, Trajan advised Pliny not to actively seek out Christians for persecution, but to punish them if they were brought before him and found guilty of being Christians. He instructed Pliny to give Christians the opportunity to renounce their faith and offer sacrifices to the Roman gods, which would demonstrate their loyalty to the empire. If they refused to do so, they were to be punished, but Trajan emphasized that Christians should not be persecuted solely for their religious beliefs.\n\n“Any one who denies being a Christian and actively proves it by adoring our gods must be forgiven on the basis of his repentance, no matter how suspect his past.”\n\n📜 Letter from Pliny to Trajan and Trajan’s Reply\n\nThe source of this text is from \n\nGeorgetown University.\n\nPliny, Letters 10.96-97\n\nPliny to the Emperor Trajan\n\nIt is my practice, my lord, to refer to you all matters concerning which I am in doubt. For who can better give guidance to my hesitation or inform my ignorance? I have never participated in trials of Christians. I therefore do not know what offenses it is the practice to punish or investigate, and to what extent. And I have been not a little hesitant as to whether there should be any distinction on account of age or no difference between the very young and the more mature; whether pardon is to be granted for repentance, or, if a man has once been a Christian, it does him no good to have ceased to be one; whether the name itself, even without offenses, or only the offenses associated with the name are to be punished.\n\nMeanwhile, in the case of those who were denounced to me as Christians, I have observed the following procedure: I interrogated these as to whether they were Christians; those who confessed I interrogated a second and a third time, threatening them with punishment; those who persisted I ordered executed. For I had no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, stubbornness and inflexible obstinacy surely deserve to be punished. There were others possessed of the same folly; but because they were Roman citizens, I signed an order for them to be transferred to Rome.\n\nSoon accusations spread, as usually happens, because of the proceedings going on, and several incidents occurred. An anonymous document was published containing the names of many persons. Those who denied that they were or had been Christians, when they invoked the gods in words dictated by me, offered prayer with incense and wine to your image, which I had ordered to be brought for this purpose together with statues of the gods, and moreover cursed Christ--none of which those who are really Christians, it is said, can be forced to do--these I thought should be discharged. Others named by the informer declared that they were Christians, but then denied it, asserting that they had been but had ceased to be, some three years before, others many years, some as much as twenty-five years. They all worshipped your image and the statues of the gods, and cursed Christ.\n\nThey asserted, however, that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind themselves by oath, not to some crime, but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not falsify their trust, nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so. When this was over, it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food--but ordinary and innocent food. Even this, they affirmed, they had ceased to do after my edict by which, in accordance with your instructions, I had forbidden political associations. Accordingly, I judged it all the more necessary to find out what the truth was by torturing two female slaves who were called deaconesses. But I discovered nothing else but depraved, excessive superstition.\n\nI therefore postponed the investigation and hastened to consult you. For the matter seemed to me to warrant consulting you, especially because of the number involved. For many persons of every age, every rank, and also of both sexes are and will be endangered. For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only to the cities but also to the villages and farms. But it seems possible to check and cure it. It is certainly quite clear that the temples, which had been almost deserted, have begun to be frequented, that the established religious rites, long neglected, are being resumed, and that from everywhere sacrificial animals are coming, for which until now very few purchasers could be found. Hence it is easy to imagine what a multitude of people can be reformed if an opportunity for repentance is afforded.\n\nTrajan to Pliny\n\nYou observed proper procedure, my dear Pliny, in sifting the cases of those who had been denounced to you as Christians. For it is not possible to lay down any general rule to serve as a kind of fixed standard. They are not to be sought out; if they are denounced and proved guilty, they are to be punished, with this reservation, that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it--that is, by worshiping our gods--even though he was under suspicion in the past, shall obtain pardon through repentance. But anonymously posted accusations ought to have no place in any prosecution. For this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age.","type":"content","url":"/martyrs#trajan-against-christians","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl3":"Decius against Christians","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/martyrs#decius-against-christians","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.3: Martyrs","lvl3":"Decius against Christians","lvl2":"What persecutions did the Martyrs face?"},"content":"Emperor Decius (249-251 AD) is known for initiating the first empire-wide persecution of Christians.

He believed that Plato’s teaching on eternal forms referred to the God of the Bible, that Socrates, (like Abraham) was ‘a Christian before Christ’, and that Socrates’ death was an example for Christian martyrs.\n\nHe was a gentile born in Samaria, converted to Christianity, and was eventually martyred for his faith. He was trained in Greek philosophy before his conversion. Martyr moved to Rome after his conversion, where he established a Christian school and engaged in public debates with pagan philosophers.\n\nHis work in the “First Apology” focus on the connection between the Old Testament and Jesus as the Messiah, arguing that Christianity was the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy.

Some see it as an escape from the world, while others view it as a legalistic approach to spirituality. However, monasticism has played a significant role in the history of Christianity, particularly in the areas of mission and cultural engagement.\n\nThe Desert Fathers and Mothers, who lived in the deserts of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine during the 3rd and 4th centuries, were some of the earliest monastic figures. They sought to live a life of radical discipleship, renouncing worldly possessions and dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and contemplation.\n\nA vision for mission\n\nMonks would see their life style as separating oneself from worldly distractions in order to commit to the spiritual struggle towards maturity in Christ. This maturity would then be a testimony to the world and a means for mission.\n\nAsceticism  can be conceived as the voluntary exercise, practice and/or training in order to separate oneself from worldly distractions and focus on union with God.\n\nThe word “monk” comes from the Greek word “monachos,” which means “solitary” or “alone.” Monks typically live in communities, but they also spend significant time in solitude and contemplation.\n\nThe word asceticism comes from the Greek word “askesis,” which means “exercise” or “training.” Ascetic practices can include fasting, celibacy, poverty, and other forms of self-denial.","type":"content","url":"/monks#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.5: Monks","lvl2":"Why is Monasticism Attractive?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/monks#why-is-monasticism-attractive","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 2.5: Monks","lvl2":"Why is Monasticism Attractive?"},"content":"Monasticism offers an alternative to those who are surrounded by the chaos of the bloodshed and moral decay of the Roman Empire. The constant instability and uncertainty of the times made the monastic life appealing to many Christians who sought a way to live out their faith in a more radical and committed manner.\n\nBut monasticism is not just an escape from the world. In the 4th century, monasticism is going to be a way to reject the syncretism and hierarchical new structure of the Church after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Monks sought to live a life of radical discipleship, renouncing worldly possessions and dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and contemplation.\n\nMonks are mostly evangelizing. They are the missionaries of their era. Therefore, they are seen as spiritual authorities by the people. People would come to them for spiritual guidance and healing. Interestingly, as monks get busier with the demand for their services, they would seek to find places more remote to continue their spiritual practices.

For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.”\n\nMatthew 19:21: “Jesus answered, ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.’”\n\nMatthew 6:34: “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”\n\nSt. Anthony the Great (c. 251-356) is often considered the father of anchrotic monasticism. He lived in the Egyptian desert for many years, dedicating himself to a life of prayer and contemplation.
