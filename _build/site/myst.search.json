The posture we assume when we pray is not a trivial matter. It reflects our understanding of who God is and who we are in relation to Him.\n\nProf. Rylaarsdam explained the origins of the expression “The Lord be with you”, recalling Boaz’s greeting to his workers in Ruth 2:4. This greeting is not just a polite expression; it carries deep theological significance. It acknowledges God’s presence and blessing in our lives, especially in communal worship settings.\n\nHe also presenteded the three postures for prayer in the ancient church (and guess what? sitting was not one of them!): standing, kneeling, and prostrating. Each posture has its own meaning and significance:\n\nStanding is a posture of respect and attentiveness,\n\nKneeling is a posture of humility and submission, and\n\nProstrating is a posture of total surrender and worship, also connected to repentance.\n\nAfter a few presentations among the students, we turned to the main question of the lecture: Why study the history of Christianity? Or as stated by Prof. Rylaarsdam, “What difference does it make to know church history?”","type":"content","url":"/why-study#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"1.

Reasons to Study Church History"},"content":"Many reasons were presented during the lecture, and I would like to summarize the main ones here:\n\nTo understand our identity as Christians: Church history helps us to see how our faith has been shaped and formed over the centuries. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story, a story that goes back to the early church and continues to this day.\n\nTo learn from the past: By studying church history, we can learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. We can see how they navigated challenges and controversies, and we can apply those lessons to our own lives and ministries.\n\nTo appreciate the diversity of the Christian tradition: Church history reveals the rich diversity of the Christian tradition. It shows us how different cultures and contexts have shaped the way we understand and practice our faith.\n\nTo deepen our faith: Studying church history can deepen our faith by helping us to see the faithfulness of God throughout the ages. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story of God’s work in the world.\n\nThe main take was that church history forms Christians for a missional encounter with culture as we observe how the church in the past did that. It is not just an academic exercise but a practical one that equips us to live out our faith in the world today.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-1-reasons-to-study-church-history","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"2.

An Alien-tropological Experience"},"content":"We can see church history as an alien-tropological experience, where we encounter the “otherness” of past Christians. If we do the exercise of pretending we are some alien anthropologists studying human culture, we can approach church history with a sense of curiosity and openness. We can learn to appreciate the differences and similarities between our own context and that of past Christians.\n\nThe example given in class invited us to travel to different ages and places in church history, trying to understand what Christians were doing, what were their priorities, and how they expressed their faith. This exercise can help us to see church history not just as a series of dates and events but as a living and dynamic story of God’s work in the world.\n\nAfter pretending to be an alien grad student, the question posed was:\n\nWhat should the grad student in interplanetary religions conclude about Christianity?\n\nOne of the points raised was the fact that Christianity has been remarkably adaptive and resilient throughout history. It has been able to take root in diverse cultures and contexts, while still maintaining its core message and identity. This adaptability is a testament to the power of the Christian faith and its ability to speak to the human condition across time and space.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-2-an-alien-tropological-experience","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"3.

How to Study Church History"},"content":"A few quotes were presented to guide us in our study of church history:\n\nIn modernity, church history has often been taught not “in terms of the missionary advance in successive encounters of the gospel with different forms of human culture and society, but rather as a story of the doctrinal and other conflicts within the life of the church.” (L. Newbigin)\n\nI wish someone had told me in seminary that the Christological and Trinitarian controversies of the second and third century were first and foremost issues of contextualization. (L. Newbigin)\n\nWe have to ask in all sincerity whether the study of the history of the church ought not to be completely redesigned. (David Bosch)\n\nThese quotes highlight the importance of approaching church history with a missional and contextual perspective. We should not just focus on doctrinal disputes but also on how the gospel has been communicated and lived out in different cultural settings.\n\nTo provide a tool for studying church history, Prof. Rylaarsdam introduced us the two principles for missional encounters with culture:\n\nThe indigenizing principle: Christianity enters a culture and finds customs that embody the way of Christ. Christians celebrate the culture. They are residents in it.\n\nThe pilgrim principle: Christianity enters a culture and finds ways in which the culture contradicts the way and teachings of Christ. Christians seek to embody alternatives. They are not fully at home; they are resident aliens (paroikoi) in it.\n\nThese two principles are constantly in conflict and tension with each other throughout church history. Christians have to navigate between celebrating the culture and embodying alternatives to it.\n\nOn paroikoi\n\nThe connection of the pilgrim principle and the idea of Christians as “resident aliens” (paroikoi) reminded me of 1 Peter 2:11-12:\n\nDear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles (paroikoi), to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.\n\nThe biggest challenge presented for us is to pursue “faithful contextualization rather than syncretistic accommodation”.\n\nSince the Gospel is translatable by its very nature, it can take on many cultural forms. In that translation the Gospel both affirms the creational good and judges the idolatrous twisting of all cultural forms. (Mike Goheen)\n\nWe then passed to the next discussion on the way to study church history faithfully by asking in each historical context:\n\nWhat’s my context?\n\nWhat’s the gospel in this context?\n\nWhat’s the mission of God’s people in this context?\n\nAs a ministry leader, how can I equip people for mission in this context?\n\nThis will be the topic for the next lecture.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#id-3-how-to-study-church-history","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"Prayers"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/why-study#prayers","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lecture 1: Why Study the History of Christianity?","lvl2":"Prayers"},"content":"Below are some prayers from early Christian writers that were shared during the lecture.\n\nClement of Alexandria’s PrayerBe kind to us, your little children, Lord – that is what we ask of you as our Tutor.  \nGrant that by doing what you have told us to do, \n    we may achieve a faithful likeness to the Image \n    and find you to be a good God and a lenient Judge.\nMay we all live in the peace that comes from you.\n    May we journey towards your city, \n        sailing through the waters of sin untouched by the waves, \n        carried peacefully along by the Holy Spirit, your Wisdom beyond all telling.  \nNight and day until the last day of all, \n    may our praises give you thanks, our thanksgiving praise you:  \n    you who alone are both Father and Son, \n    the Son who is our Tutor and our Teacher, together with the Holy Spirit.  \nAmen.","type":"content","url":"/why-study#prayers","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Story Of Christianity I"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Story Of Christianity I"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Story Of Christianity I","lvl2":"Introduction"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#introduction","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Story Of Christianity I","lvl2":"Introduction"},"content":"This is a journal documenting my journey through the course “Story Of Christianity I” offered by Calvin Seminary.
