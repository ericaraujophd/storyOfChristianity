to us, your little children, Lord – that is what we ask of you as our Tutor.  \nGrant that by doing what you have told us to do, \n    we may achieve a faithful likeness to the Image \n    and find you to be a good God and a lenient Judge.\nMay we all live in the peace that comes from you.\n    May we journey towards your city, \n        sailing through the waters of sin untouched by the waves, \n        carried peacefully along by the Holy Spirit, your Wisdom beyond all telling.  \nNight and day until the last day of all, \n    may our praises give you thanks, our thanksgiving praise you:
