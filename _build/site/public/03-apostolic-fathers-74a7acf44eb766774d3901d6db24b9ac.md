## Introduction

Very little is known about the period between the New Testament writings and the early second century. However, we do have some writings from early Christian leaders known as the Apostolic Fathers. These writings provide valuable insights into the beliefs, practices, and challenges faced by the early Christian community during this formative period.

Some of the main sources from the Apostolic Fathers include:

1. 1 Clement
2. Didache
3. Ignatius of Antioch’s 7 Letters
4. Epistle of Barnabas
5. The Shepherd of Hermas (ca. 90-150)

What does this literature tell us how early Christians (90-150 AD) perceived their mission in Hellenistic culture?

:::{admonition} Hellenistic culture
:class: tip
The Hellenistic culture, which emerged after the conquests of Alexander the Great, was characterized by the spread of Greek language, art, architecture, and philosophy throughout the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions. This cultural milieu significantly influenced the development of early Christianity, as it provided a common language (Koine Greek) and a rich intellectual tradition that early Christians engaged with in their theological reflections and missionary efforts.

## Didache

The [Didache](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/richardson/fathers.viii.i.iii.html), also known as "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles," is an early Christian document that provides instructions on various aspects of Christian life and practice. It was written in the late first or early second century. It covers topics such as baptism, fasting, prayer, the Eucharist, and church organization. The Didache reflects the communal and ethical dimensions of early Christian life, emphasizing the importance of living according to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.

The first part of the Didache focuses on ethical teachings, including the "Two Ways" doctrine, which contrasts the way of life (following God's commandments) with the way of death (sinful behavior). The second part provides practical instructions for Christian rituals and community life.

## 1 Clement

The letter known as [1 Clement](https://ccel.org/ccel/clement_rome/first_epistle_to_the_corinthians/anf01.ii.html) is attributed to Clement of Rome, who was a prominent leader in the early Christian community in Rome. The letter was written to the church in Corinth around 99 AD, addressing a dispute that had arisen within the Corinthian church regarding leadership and authority. This letter contains the same substance as Paul's letters, emphasizing humility, unity, and obedience to church leaders.

## Ignatius of Antioch’s 7 Letters

Ignatius of Antioch was an early Christian bishop who wrote a series of letters to various Christian communities while on his way to Rome for martyrdom around 110 AD. His letters emphasize the importance of church unity, the role of bishops, and the significance of the Eucharist. Ignatius strongly advocated for obedience to church leaders and warned against divisions within the Christian community. He also highlighted the reality of persecution and the need for Christians to remain faithful in the face of suffering.

## Epistle of Barnabas

The [Epistle of Barnabas](https://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.vi.html) is an early Christian writing that was likely composed in the late first or early second century. It is attributed to Barnabas, a companion of the Apostle Paul, although the true authorship is uncertain. The epistle addresses various theological themes, including the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, the interpretation of Old Testament scriptures, and the ethical conduct expected of Christians. The Epistle of Barnabas emphasizes the idea that Christians are the true heirs of God's covenant, interpreting Old Testament laws in a spiritualized manner.

## The Shepherd of Hermas

The Shepherd of Hermas is an early Christian literary work that was likely written in the mid-second century. It is a visionary text that combines elements of apocalyptic literature, moral exhortation, and allegory. The work is presented as a series of visions and parables experienced by a Christian named Hermas, who is guided by a figure known as the Shepherd. The Shepherd of Hermas addresses themes such as repentance, forgiveness, and the importance of living a virtuous life. It also reflects the challenges faced by the early Christian community, including issues of sin, discipline, and the hope for ultimate salvation.
