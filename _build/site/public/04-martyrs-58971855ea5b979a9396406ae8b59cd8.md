It is important to rememeber the main figures of the second-century who were shaping the new church identity in the context of the Roman Empire:

- The Apostolic Fathers
- The Martyrs
- The Apologists
- The Monks

We have talked about the Apostolic Fathers in the last lecture. Now we will focus on the Martyrs.

## 1. Who were the Martyrs?

The term "martyr" comes from the Greek word "μάρτυς" (mártus), which means "witness." In the context of early Christianity, martyrs were individuals who bore witness to their faith in Jesus Christ, even to the point of death. The early Christian martyrs were often persecuted by the Roman authorities for their refusal to renounce their faith and participate in the state-sanctioned religious practices, which were seen as a threat to the unity and stability of the Roman Empire.

The stories of the martyrs were highly influential in shaping the identity and theology of the early Christian church. Their courage and steadfastness in the face of persecution served as powerful examples of faith and devotion, inspiring other Christians to remain faithful even in difficult circumstances. The martyrdom of early Christians was often seen as a form of participation in the suffering and death of Christ, and it was believed that those who died for their faith would receive special rewards in the afterlife.
