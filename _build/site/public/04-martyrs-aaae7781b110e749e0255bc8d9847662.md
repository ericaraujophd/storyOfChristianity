It is important to rememeber the main figures of the second-century who were shaping the new church identity in the context of the Roman Empire:

- The Apostolic Fathers
- The Martyrs
- The Apologists
- The Monks

We have talked about the Apostolic Fathers in the last lecture. Now we will focus on the Martyrs.

## Who were the Martyrs?

The term "martyr" comes from the Greek word "μάρτυς" (mártus), which means "witness." In the context of early Christianity, martyrs were individuals who bore witness to their faith in Jesus Christ, even to the point of death. The early Christian martyrs were often persecuted by the Roman authorities for their refusal to renounce their faith and participate in the state-sanctioned religious practices, which were seen as a threat to the unity and stability of the Roman Empire.

The stories of the martyrs were highly influential in shaping the identity and theology of the early Christian church. Their courage and steadfastness in the face of persecution served as powerful examples of faith and devotion, inspiring other Christians to remain faithful even in difficult circumstances. The martyrdom of early Christians was often seen as a form of participation in the suffering and death of Christ, and it was believed that those who died for their faith would receive special rewards in the afterlife.

## What was the Gospel for the Martyrs?

A great deal of Scriptural texts were used by the early Christians to encourage and strengthen the faith of the martyrs. Some of the key passages that were particularly meaningful to them include:

- **Mark 8:34-35**: "Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: 'Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.'"
- **Matthew 5:10-12**: "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
- **Philippians 1:21**: "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
- **2 Corinthians 12:10**: "That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."
- **2 Timothy 4:6-8**: "For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."
- **Revelation 14:13**: "Then I heard a voice from heaven say, 'Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.' 'Yes,' says the Spirit, 'they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.'"
- **Romans 8:35-39**: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: 'For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.' No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
- **Revelation 2:10**: "Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown."

It is important to remember that Stephen's martyrdom and Jesus' crucifixion set models for the early Christian martyrs. Stephen, as the first Christian martyr, exemplified forgiveness and faithfulness even in the face of death (Acts 7:54-60). Jesus' own suffering and death on the cross served as the ultimate example of sacrificial love and obedience to God's will (Philippians 2:5-11). These examples provided a theological framework for understanding martyrdom as a participation in Christ's own suffering and a witness to the truth of the gospel.

The martyrs of the early church would see themselves as [Paroikoi](#paroikoi) (resident aliens), a very important concept for the martyrs, as they saw themselves as pilgrims in this world, not fully at home, and looking forward to their true home in heaven.

Later, when Christianity become legal in the Roman Empire, the pilgrim principle will be co-existing with the indigenizing principle, which will create tensions in the church.

The paradox of the Christian life is a very good place to reflect upon the experience of the martyrs. Christians are called to live in the world but not be of the world (John 17:14-16). They are to be in the world as witnesses to the truth of the gospel, but they are also called to embody an alternative way of life that reflects the values of the kingdom of God. 

The concept of dual citizenship captures this paradox, as Christians are citizens of both the earthly kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. This dual citizenship creates a tension between the demands of the world and the demands of faith, which the martyrs experienced in a profound way.

Diognetus Epistle provides a beautiful description of the Christian identity as resident aliens:

> "They live in their respective countries, but only as resident aliens [paroikoi](#paroikoi); they participate in all things as citizens, and they endure all things as foreigners [...] They marry like everyone else and have children, but they do not expose them once they are born. They share their meals but not their sexual partners [...] To put the matter simply, what the soul is in the body, this is what Christians are in the world."

## What persecutions did the Martyrs face?

First, it is important to understand that the persecutions faced by the early Christian martyrs were not constant or uniform throughout the Roman Empire. There were periods of relative peace and tolerance, as well as times of intense persecution. The severity and frequency of persecutions varied depending on the local political and social context, as well as the attitudes of individual emperors and governors.

It is notable that the first persecutors of Christians were not the Roman authorities, but rather the Jewish religious leaders. The stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:54-60) and the persecution led by Saul (later Paul) (Acts 8:1-3) are examples of early persecutions initiated by Jewish authorities.

Justo Gonzalez [@gonzalez2010story] explains well that, at first, Jews had some privileges in the Roman Empire to practice their religion freely. As Christianity emerged from Judaism, there was this misunderstanding that Christians were just a sect of Judaism.

However, as Christianity began to emerge as a distinct movement from Judaism, tensions arose between the two groups. Christians were often viewed with suspicion and hostility by Jewish authorities, who saw them as a threat to their religious and social order.

There was certainly an increase in persecutions during the reign of Emperor Nero (54-68 AD), particularly after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, which Nero blamed on the Christians. This led to widespread persecution and martyrdom of Christians in Rome. [@gonzalez2010story] will again help us understand that Christians were easy targets for Nero, as they were a marginalized and misunderstood group in Roman society. They were often accused of atheism (due to their refusal to worship the Roman gods) and of engaging in secret and subversive activities. This made them vulnerable to persecution, especially during times of crisis or unrest.

Interestingly, there are no records of empire-wide persecutions of Christians until the reign of Emperor Decius (249-251 AD). Decius issued an edict in 250 AD that required all citizens of the empire to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods and the emperor, which Christians refused to do. This led to a widespread persecution of Christians throughout the empire, with many being arrested, tortured, and executed for their faith.
