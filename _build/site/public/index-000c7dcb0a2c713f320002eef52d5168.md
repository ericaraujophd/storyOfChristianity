## Introduction

This is a journal documenting my journey through the course "Story Of Christianity I" offered by Calvin Seminary. The course explores the history of Christianity from its origins to the medieval period, examining key events, figures, and theological developments.

This journal will include summaries of lectures, reflections on readings, and personal insights gained throughout the course. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the material covered and to deepen my understanding of the Christian faith and its historical context. The main goal is to inform myself and keep track of the knowledge acquired during this educational experience.
