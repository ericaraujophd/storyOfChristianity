## Introduction

It was a great surprise to start this course with the question of what different it makes if we stand, kneel, or sit to pray. The posture we assume when we pray is not a trivial matter. It reflects our understanding of who God is and who we are in relation to Him.

Prof. Rylaarsdam explained the origins of the expression "The Lord be with you", recalling Boaz's greeting to his workers in Ruth 2:4. This greeting is not just a polite expression; it carries deep theological significance. It acknowledges God's presence and blessing in our lives, especially in communal worship settings.

He also presenteded the three postures for prayer in the ancient church (and guess what? sitting was not one of them!): standing, kneeling, and prostrating. Each posture has its own meaning and significance:

- Standing is a posture of respect and attentiveness,
- Kneeling is a posture of humility and submission, and
- Prostrating is a posture of total surrender and worship, also connected to repentance.

After a few presentations among the students, we turned to the main question of the lecture: Why study the history of Christianity? Or as stated by Prof. Rylaarsdam, "What difference does it make to know church history?"

## Reasons to Study Church History

Many reasons were presented during the lecture, and I would like to summarize the main ones here:

1. **To understand our identity as Christians**: Church history helps us to see how our faith has been shaped and formed over the centuries. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story, a story that goes back to the early church and continues to this day.
2. **To learn from the past**: By studying church history, we can learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. We can see how they navigated challenges and controversies, and we can apply those lessons to our own lives and ministries.
3. **To appreciate the diversity of the Christian tradition**: Church history reveals the rich diversity of the Christian tradition. It shows us how different cultures and contexts have shaped the way we understand and practice our faith.
4. **To deepen our faith**: Studying church history can deepen our faith by helping us to see the faithfulness of God throughout the ages. It reminds us that we are part of a larger story of God's work in the world.

The main take was that church history forms Christians for a missional encounter with culture as we observe how the church in the past did that. It is not just an academic exercise but a practical one that equips us to live out our faith in the world today.

## Church History as an Alien-tropological Experience

We can see church history as an alien-tropological experience, where we encounter the "otherness" of past Christians. If we do the exercise of pretending we are some alien anthropologists studying human culture, we can approach church history with a sense of curiosity and openness. We can learn to appreciate the differences and similarities between our own context and that of past Christians.

The example given in class invited us to travel to different ages and places in church history, trying to understand what Christians were doing, what were their priorities, and how they expressed their faith. This exercise can help us to see church history not just as a series of dates and events but as a living and dynamic story of God's work in the world.

After pretending to be an alien grad student, the question posed was:

What should the grad student in interplanetary religions conclude about Christianity?

One of the points raised was the fact that Christianity has been remarkably adaptive and resilient throughout history. It has been able to take root in diverse cultures and contexts, while still maintaining its core message and identity. This adaptability is a testament to the power of the Christian faith and its ability to speak to the human condition across time and space.
