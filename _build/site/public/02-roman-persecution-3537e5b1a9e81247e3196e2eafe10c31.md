## Introduction

This lecture happened on September 8, 2025, and it focused on the Roman empire's persecution of Christians. Prof. Rylaarsdam discussed the historical context of the Roman Empire during the first few centuries AD, highlighting the political, social, and religious factors that contributed to the persecution of Christians.

A great part of the class was to discuss the Introduction of the book "On the Incarnation" by Athanasius of Alexandria. This introduction was written by C.S. Lewis, and it is an encouragement for those who want to understand the early church to read the original sources. [@athanasius1891incarnation]

## 1. The first church council: a judaizing heresy

Acts 15 describes the first church council, which took place in Jerusalem around 50 AD. The council was convened to address the question of whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to follow Jewish customs and laws, such as circumcision and dietary restrictions. The council ultimately decided that Gentile converts did not need to follow these customs, but they were asked to abstain from certain practices that were particularly offensive to Jewish Christians, such as eating food sacrificed to idols.

The meeting of the council was significant because it marked a turning point in the early church's understanding of its identity and mission. It affirmed that Christianity was not simply a sect of Judaism but a distinct faith that welcomed Gentile believers. This decision helped to pave the way for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.

It is quite fascinating that they wrote down the decisions of the council in a letter to be sent to the churches. This shows the importance of communication and unity in the early church, as well as the recognition that the decisions made at the council had implications for the wider Christian community.

28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 

29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. 

Farewell.

## 2. The ancient church and their 4 periods

The lecture then moved to refresh the illustration of the seminary alien grad student and his perceptions of Christianity. Regarding the indigenizing and pilgrim principles, it was noted that there are good things in every culture that can be celebrated by Christians. However, there are also bad things that need to be rejected or redeemed.

Some recommendation of Andrew Walls' work on the history of Christianity and culture was given, particularly his book "The Missionary Movement in Christian History: Studies in the Transmission of Faith." [@walls2015missionary]

A discussion on faithful contextualization followed, starting by the presentation of the ancient church context.

The ancient church from 100-313 AD faced mainly two challenges:

1. What is our identity in relation to Judaism?
2. How do we engage with the surrounding idolatrous Greco-Roman culture?

And these first centuries will be the focus of the following lectures. Later, the other three periods of church history will be presented. The four periods can be summarized as follows:

| Period | Time Period | Key Events |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Ancient Church | 100-313 | Apostolic Fathers – Edict of Milan |
| Christian Empire | 313-600 | Edict of Milan – Gregory the Great |
| Early Middle Ages | 600-1054 | Gregory the Great – Great Schism |
| High Middle Ages | 1054-1274 | Great Schism – Bonaventure/Aquinas |


## 3. The Roman Empire Context (What is the Context?)

### Political Context

To understand the period from 100-313 AD, we need to understand the context of the Roman Empire during this time. The empire was vast and diverse, encompassing many different cultures and religions. The Roman government was generally tolerant of different religious practices, as long as they did not threaten the stability of the empire. However, Christians were often viewed with suspicion and hostility by the Roman authorities.

Politically, there is unity and peace in the Roman Empire. No major wars were happening for the last 200 years. This period is known as the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. The empire was ruled by a series of emperors who maintained order and stability throughout the empire. The mentality that trusting in the goodness of human beings brought the hope of a permanent social order.

The Roman ideal became part of the cultural fabric of the empire. The emperor was seen as a divine figure, and loyalty to the empire was considered a civic duty. This created a challenging environment for Christians, who refused to worship the emperor or participate in certain civic rituals that were seen as idolatrous.

### Cultural Context

Culturally, the unified language, cultural uniformity, art, education (paideia), transportation, and communication networks helped to create a sense of shared identity and purpose among the diverse peoples of the empire.

:::{admonition} Paideia
:class: tip
The Greek word "paideia" refers to the system of education and cultural upbringing in ancient Greece and Rome. It encompassed not only formal education but also the broader cultural values, norms, and practices that shaped individuals into well-rounded citizens. Paideia emphasized the development of intellectual, moral, and physical virtues, aiming to cultivate individuals who could contribute positively to society. In the Roman context, paideia included the study of literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and the arts, as well as physical training and civic responsibility.

Despite the general peace and stability of the Roman Empire during this period, the decadence of morality and the increasing use of Latin as the common language in the western part of the empire were signs of decline.

### Moral and Religious Context

The moral decline of the Roman Empire is certainly connected to the religious situation, where a polytheistic and syncretistic approach to religion prevailed, leading to moral decay and spiritual emptiness. Also, there were two Roman Empires. The one worshiped by the people and the one that actually ruled. The intelligentsia was mostly skeptical of the traditional Roman religion and used it in a utilitarian way.

:::{admonition} What is true?
:class: important

Pontius Pilate posture when interrogating Jesus is a good representation of the Roman attitude towards religion: "What is truth?" (John 18:38). This question reflects the relativistic and pragmatic approach to religion that characterized the Roman Empire during this period.

Another characteristic of the Roman context is that life was cheap. The widespread acceptance of practices such as gladiatorial games, public executions, and other forms of entertainment that involved violence and death reflected a culture that devalued human life. This moral climate created a challenging environment for Christians, who were called to uphold the sanctity of life and reject the prevailing cultural norms.

## 3. Making disciples who make disciples (What is the mission?)

Fledging (early) Christians were called to make disciples who make disciples in this challenging context. The mission of the church was to proclaim the gospel and to live out the teachings of Jesus in a way that was faithful to their identity as followers of Christ.

The life of Christians in this period was marked by persecution and suffering, as they faced hostility from both the Roman authorities and the surrounding culture. The main figures of this period were:

- Apostolic Fathers: Early Christian writers who were direct disciples of the apostles, such as Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, and Polycarp of Smyrna. They provided guidance and encouragement to the early Christian communities.
- Martyrs: Christians who were persecuted and killed for their faith, such as Stephen, Perpetua, and Felicity. Their witness and sacrifice inspired others to remain faithful in the face of persecution.
- Apologists: Christian writers who defended the faith against pagan criticisms and misconceptions, such as Justin Martyr and Tertullian. They sought to explain and justify Christian beliefs and practices in a way that was understandable to the broader culture.
- Monks: Although monasticism would develop more fully in later centuries, some early forms of asceticism and communal living can be traced back to this period. Early ascetics sought to live lives of holiness and devotion, often withdrawing from the world to focus on prayer and spiritual discipline.

And that's where we will pick up in the next lecture!
