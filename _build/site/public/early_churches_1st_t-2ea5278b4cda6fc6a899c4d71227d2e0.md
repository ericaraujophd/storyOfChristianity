## Important Notes on Sources & Terminology

### Apostolic Foundation
Churches claimed to be founded directly by apostles or their immediate disciples.

### House Churches
Early Christian communities met in private homes for the first ~200 years. Purpose-built church buildings did not appear until early 3rd century.

### Traditional vs. Historical Evidence
Early church traditions (from Church Fathers like Irenaeus, Tertullian, Eusebius) often differ from modern historical scholarship. Dating and founding attributions are frequently uncertain.

### The Five Patriarchates
By the 4th-5th centuries, five major sees emerged (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem) - formally recognized at Ecumenical Councils.

### Chronological Challenges
Exact founding dates for many 1st-century churches are uncertain; Acts and Epistles provide primary sources but don't always specify precise dates.

## Key Observations for Teaching

1. **Geographic Spread:** Christianity spread rapidly from Jerusalem through the Mediterranean basin, following trade routes and Roman roads.

2. **Paul's Missionary Work:** The apostle Paul was instrumental in establishing churches across Asia Minor, Greece, and reaching Rome. His epistles are the earliest New Testament writings.

3. **Cultural Adaptation:** Early churches adapted to local contexts—Jewish in Jerusalem, Hellenistic in Greece and Asia Minor, Latin in North Africa and Rome.

4. **Leadership Development:** Church organization evolved from charismatic leadership (apostolic age) to structured leadership (bishops and presbyters) by the 2nd century, with formal patriarchates emerging by the 4th century.

5. **Evidence vs. Tradition:** Many founding traditions (e.g., Peter founding Rome or Mark founding Alexandria) come from 2nd-century church fathers and may not reflect historical reality. Students should learn to distinguish between tradition and evidence.

6. **Material Culture:** Archaeological evidence (catacombs, house church remains at Dura-Europos, inscriptions) provides important corroboration of textual sources.

7. **Persecution and Growth:** Despite sporadic persecutions (especially under Nero, Diocletian), Christianity grew dramatically—estimated at ~10% of the Roman population by 300 AD.
