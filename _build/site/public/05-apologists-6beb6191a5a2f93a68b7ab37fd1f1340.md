This is list is not exhaustive, but it includes some of the most prominent figures who contributed to the development of Christian theology and defended the faith against various criticisms during this period.

## Purpose of Apologies

The primary purposes of these apologies were:

- To defend Christianity against accusations and misconceptions held by both pagan and Jewish critics. (defensive)
- To advance the understanding of Christian beliefs and practices among non-Christians. (offensive)
- To demonstrate the reasonableness and moral superiority of the Christian faith. (evangelistic)
- To encourage and strengthen the faith of Christian believers in the face of persecution and societal pressure. (constructive)

## Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 AD)

Justin Martyr is one of the most well-known early Christian apologists. He wrote several works defending Christianity, including "First Apology" and "Second Apology." In these writings, Justin addressed the Roman authorities and the general public, explaining Christian beliefs and practices while refuting common accusations against Christians, such as atheism and immorality.

Martyr welcomed classical philosophy, particularly Platonism, as a way to understand and articulate Christian doctrine. He believed that truth could be found in both Christian revelation and philosophical inquiry.

:::{admonition} Martyr and Plato
Justin Martyr welcomed classical philosophy.  He believed that Plato’s teaching on eternal forms referred to the God of the Bible, that Socrates, (like Abraham) was ‘a Christian before Christ’, and that Socrates’ death was an example for Christian martyrs.
:::

He was a gentile born in Samaria, converted to Christianity, and was eventually martyred for his faith. He was trained in Greek philosophy before his conversion. Martyr moved to Rome after his conversion, where he established a Christian school and engaged in public debates with pagan philosophers.

His work in the "First Apology" focus on the connection between the Old Testament and Jesus as the Messiah, arguing that Christianity was the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy. He also addressed ethical teachings, emphasizing the moral superiority of Christian living compared to pagan practices.
