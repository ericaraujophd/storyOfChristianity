## Introduction

It was a great surprise to start this course with the question of what different it makes if we stand, kneel, or sit to pray. The posture we assume when we pray is not a trivial matter. It reflects our understanding of who God is and who we are in relation to Him.

Prof. Rylaarsdam explained the origins of the expression "The Lord be with you", recalling Boaz's greeting to his workers in Ruth 2:4. This greeting is not just a polite expression; it carries deep theological significance. It acknowledges God's presence and blessing in our lives, especially in communal worship settings.

He also presenteded the three postures for prayer in the ancient church (and guess what? sitting was not one of them!): standing, kneeling, and prostrating. Each posture has its own meaning and significance. 

- Standing is a posture of respect and attentiveness,
- Kneeling is a posture of humility and submission, and
- Prostrating is a posture of total surrender and worship, also connected to repentance.
