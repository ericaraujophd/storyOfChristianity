## Introduction

It was a great surprise to start this course with the question of what different it makes if we stand, kneel, or sit to pray. The posture we assume when we pray is not a trivial matter. It reflects our understanding of who God is and who we are in relation to Him.

Prof. Rylaarsdam explained the origins of the expression "The Lord be with you", recalling Boaz's greeting to his workers in Ruth 2:4. This greeting is not just a polite expression; it carries deep theological significance. It acknowledges God's presence and blessing in our lives, especially in communal worship settings.
