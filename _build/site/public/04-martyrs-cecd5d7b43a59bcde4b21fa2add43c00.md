It is important to rememeber the main figures of the second-century who were shaping the new church identity in the context of the Roman Empire:

- The Apostolic Fathers
- The Martyrs
- The Apologists
- The Monks

We have talked about the Apostolic Fathers in the last lecture. Now we will focus on the Martyrs.

## Who were the Martyrs?

The term "martyr" comes from the Greek word "μάρτυς" (mártus), which means "witness." In the context of early Christianity, martyrs were individuals who bore witness to their faith in Jesus Christ, even to the point of death. The early Christian martyrs were often persecuted by the Roman authorities for their refusal to renounce their faith and participate in the state-sanctioned religious practices, which were seen as a threat to the unity and stability of the Roman Empire.

The stories of the martyrs were highly influential in shaping the identity and theology of the early Christian church. Their courage and steadfastness in the face of persecution served as powerful examples of faith and devotion, inspiring other Christians to remain faithful even in difficult circumstances. The martyrdom of early Christians was often seen as a form of participation in the suffering and death of Christ, and it was believed that those who died for their faith would receive special rewards in the afterlife.

## What was the Gospel for the Martyrs?

A great deal of Scriptural texts were used by the early Christians to encourage and strengthen the faith of the martyrs. Some of the key passages that were particularly meaningful to them include:

- **Mark 8:
- **Matthew 5:10-12**: "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
- **Romans 8:35-39**: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: 'For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.' No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
- **2 Timothy 4:6-8**: "For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing."
- **Revelation 2:10**: "Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown."
