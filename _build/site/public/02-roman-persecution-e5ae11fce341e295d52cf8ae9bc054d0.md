## Introduction

This lecture happened on September 8, 2025, and it focused on the Roman empire's persecution of Christians. Prof. Rylaarsdam discussed the historical context of the Roman Empire during the first few centuries AD, highlighting the political, social, and religious factors that contributed to the persecution of Christians.

## 1. The first church council: a judaizing heresy

Acts 15 describes the first church council, which took place in Jerusalem around 50 AD. The council was convened to address the question of whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to follow Jewish customs and laws, such as circumcision and dietary restrictions. The council ultimately decided that Gentile converts did not need to follow these customs, but they were asked to abstain from certain practices that were particularly offensive to Jewish Christians, such as eating food sacrificed to idols.

The meeting of the council was significant because it marked a turning point in the early church's understanding of its identity and mission. It affirmed that Christianity was not simply a sect of Judaism but a distinct faith that welcomed Gentile believers. This decision helped to pave the way for the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.

It is quite fascinating that they wrote down the decisions of the council in a letter to be sent to the churches. This shows the importance of communication and unity in the early church, as well as the recognition that the decisions made at the council had implications for the wider Christian community.

28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 

29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. 

Farewell.

## 2. Persecution in the Roman Empire

The lecture then moved to refresh the illustration of the seminary alien grad student and his perceptions of Christianity. Regarding the indigenizing and pilgrim principles, it was noted that there are good things in every culture that can be celebrated by Christians. However, there are also bad things that need to be rejected or redeemed.

Some recommendation of Andrew Walls' work on the history of Christianity and culture was given, particularly his book "[The Missionary Movement in Christian History: Studies in the Transmission of Faith.]()"
