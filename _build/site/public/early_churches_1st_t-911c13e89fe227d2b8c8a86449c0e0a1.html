        <h3>Important Notes on Sources & Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apostolic Foundation:</strong> Churches claimed to be founded directly by apostles or their immediate disciples.</li>
            <li><strong>House Churches:</strong> Early Christian communities met in private homes for the first ~200 years. Purpose-built church buildings did not appear until early 3rd century.</li>
            <li><strong>Traditional vs. Historical Evidence:</strong> Early church traditions (from Church Fathers like Irenaeus, Tertullian, Eusebius) often differ from modern historical scholarship. Dating and founding attributions are frequently uncertain.</li>
            <li><strong>The Five Patriarchates:</strong> By the 4th-5th centuries, five major sees emerged (Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem) - formally recognized at Ecumenical Councils.</li>
            <li><strong>Chronological Challenges:</strong> Exact founding dates for many 1st-century churches are uncertain; Acts and Epistles provide primary sources but don't always specify precise dates.</li>
        </ul>
