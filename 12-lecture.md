## Leadership 313-600 A.D.

4th century: remarkable century of leadership.

What are the problems of our days? Secularization, technology, consumerism, individualism.

**The Christian paideia (4c).**

In the Greek culture, the leaders are the philosophers. In the Roman culture, the leaders are the politicians and military leaders. In the early church, the leader is Jesus Christ.

Augustine's quote on leadership reminds the church that they are all students of Christ.

psycho - leading souls (from the greek)

## Goal of leadership

The main goal of leadership is to form a thriving human being, in communion with God and others.

Paul was a model of Christian psychagogy. He was a spiritual father to many churches.

Ephesians 4 as an example of what a leader should do: equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.

Primary means to guide people: character, communal practices, teaching.

  - attract souls
  - persuades souls
